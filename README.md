# What is this for?

I wrote this document to describe my management style and my thoughts on how to efficiently work together with my reports. I am hoping this document will give you an intro to how I like to operate and what I expect from others.

# About me

I'm based in Porto, Portugal. I have a CS college degree and most of my work experience has been related to software engineering. Other than that, I owned and managed an ecommerce website that sold small size shoes to the Dutch and German markets for over 10 years (yes, Dutch people are the tallest on average so feel free to ask me about this). I love coding but I also enjoy the adrenaline of running a business.

I am not a morning person and I tend to be productive during afternoons. I prefer having clear goals as they keep me focused and prevent me from procrastinating. I try to keep things simple and can sometimes be skeptical about some of the new technology trends/hypes.

# My role

As a manager, it is my job to manage and keep the engineering teams running as smoothly and happily as possible without getting too much in their way. I like to avoid micromanaging as much as possible so I will try to provide early feedback if things are not going as expected.

Even though some of my days are quite busy and full meetings, I should be available to talk to my reports whenever possible. In the cases where I do not reply immediately. I will try to get back to you as soon as I am available.

My calendar is open to everyone I work with: please schedule new ones right after existing ones so I can get some larger blocks of time for some heads-down work. Since I still have a few meeting with people in Boston, I usually start late in the morning (after 10am) and leave after 7pm in most days so my schedule overlaps with US working hours. I will also reply to emails/slack from my phone after that if the topic seems urgent but I don't expect my reports to do that. 

I like autonomous low-touch teams that proactively look for valuable work and answers to their questions.

# 1:1s

My 1:1s are weekly 30-min meetings by default but cadence and duration can change if necessary. 

The agenda of these meetings should be primarily defined by you, keep a list of topics you would like to talk about.

* Urgent matters should not wait for 1:1s.
* Safe environment - opportunity to talk about things you would not talk in a group setting:
    * what you need
    * what you wish could be different
    * how you feel about our team and your teammates
    * what your career goals are... etc. 
* These are primarily for you and secondarily for me.
* Status updates should be the exception, not the rule.

I'm here for guidance, coaching and to help otherwise as needed.

# Feedback

Ideally, we will provide **each other** feedback that is:

* Given with the intent of helping the other person grow.
* Aimed at behavior, not the person. "You are dumb" is not feedback, it is an attack on the person.
* Actionable and explicit as to what improved behavior looks like.
* Given as quickly as possible. Timely feedback provides a tighter loop to reorient behavior.
* Radical Candor makes a lot of sense. I want to provide feedback in which it is plainly obvious that I both care about you and believe it will help you grow.

In the past, I've been told I wasn't providing enough feedback. If I do this, please call me out.

# My Expectations

You're very good at your job but you will tell me if you need help. I won't show you how to do your job but I will be around to help you make good decisions.

I expect people to be honest with me and with their peers and to be cooperative instead of competitive. It's ok to disagree with me, healthy debates are welcome.

My goal is to be able to take one month off  and not be worried about it :)

# WIP
